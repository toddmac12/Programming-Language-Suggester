## Description

This an application for people interested in coding to decide which language they should learn first. Keep in mind that even though all languages have similarities and switching between languages and platforms is very common in both internships and jobs, applicants should still put some thought into which language they should learn.

Here are three languages that prospective learners should consider, they are :

Ruby
JavaScript
Python


The Programming Language Suggester will asks future students 5 questions about themselves and provides a language suggestion based on their answers as well as a link to Epicodus Computer Boot Camp School.
